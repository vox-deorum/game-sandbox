"""The agent interface, as an abstract base class.

Participants implement four methods, two required and two optional. The required pair is
declared here as ``@abstractmethod``; the optional pair (``learn`` and ``chat``) is **not**
declared, not even as a no-op default, because the harness detects the optional hooks by
presence (:func:`has_learn`, :func:`has_chat`). A default implementation would make every
agent look like it learns and chats, and the harness would spend a hook call and clock time
(hook time counts against the limits, see :mod:`game_sandbox_harness.session`) on agents
that do nothing. The optional hooks are documented in this class's docstring instead.

The template repo carries its own plain-class copy of this interface, because participants
develop against vanilla PettingZoo and never install the harness (one stub per environment
layer, ``templates/<env>/agent.py``). Detection is therefore structural — :func:`is_agent`
checks that ``reset`` and ``act`` exist and are callable, never ``isinstance`` — and a test
asserts the two copies agree method-for-method so they cannot drift.

    Required methods:

    - ``reset(seed)`` prepares the agent for a new episode. The same seed the environment
      receives is passed here, so a stochastic agent can be made reproducible.
    - ``act(observation)`` returns an action in the environment's action space.

    Optional methods, detected by presence (do not declare them unless you implement them):

    - ``learn(observation, action, reward, terminated)`` is called after each environment
      step with that step's transition, so a reinforcement-learning agent can keep updating
      during play. Its time counts against the per-step and per-episode limits.
    - ``chat(inbox)`` is called on the agent's turn with the messages addressed to its slot;
      it returns messages to send, or nothing to stay silent. Defined and detected in Stage
      2 but never called until messaging routing arrives in Stage 8.
