"""The submission manifest and the agent loader.

``manifest.json`` at a repository root names the entry-point module, the agent class, and
the integer template-dependency-set version the repo targets. :func:`load_agent` parses and
validates the manifest, puts the repo root on ``sys.path``, imports the module, resolves the
class, and instantiates it with no arguments — all episode state is established in
``reset(seed)``. This is exactly the mechanism the Stage 3 session container uses per slot,
one repo root each, loaded by this same function. Stage 2 does not sandbox the import:
participant code runs in-process with the harness by design; isolation is the container's
job.

Every failure raises :class:`ManifestError` naming the repo, the field, and the failure,
because in Stage 5 these messages are surfaced to the participant whose build failed.

Known limitation: per-slot code isolation holds at *load* time, not at *act* time. When one
container hosts several slots, :func:`load_agent` evicts a prior root's modules from
``sys.modules`` before importing the next entry point, so two repos that import a same-named
helper *at module top* each get their own (see the loader tests). But every loaded root stays on
``sys.path`` (most-recent first) for the life of the process, and ``sys.modules`` is shared. So a
helper a repo imports *lazily inside* ``act`` (``import helper`` in the method body rather than at
the top of the module) resolves against the last-loaded slot's directory and is then cached under
that bare name for every seat. Two seats that each lazily import their own ``helper`` therefore
share whichever one imported first. Fixing this properly needs per-slot module namespacing (or a
separate interpreter per slot), which is a larger change than the container's current in-process
model; until then, keep the container to one slot per process, or have submissions import their
helpers at module top, where the eviction already isolates them. ``test_manifest.py`` pins this
boundary so the limit stays visible rather than silently surprising a later stage.
