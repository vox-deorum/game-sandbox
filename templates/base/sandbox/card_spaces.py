"""The shared Gymnasium spaces for a semantic playing-card observation.

A card is ``{"suit": <0..3>, "rank": <2..14>}``, a hand is a sequence of cards, and a trick is a
play-ordered sequence of ``{"seat", "card"}`` records. Declaring :data:`CARD`, :data:`HAND`, and
:data:`TRICK` once means every card environment publishes the same shapes. It imports its sibling
:mod:`card_utils` (never a rules engine) and, like the codec, syncs verbatim into the student
template as ``sandbox.card_spaces``.
