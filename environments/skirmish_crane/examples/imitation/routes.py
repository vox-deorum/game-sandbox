"""Terrain-aware route costs for the practice.

Two enemies may stand the same number of steps from a unit, yet the route to one crosses a marsh
while the route to the other stays on grass. To tell them apart, route_cost finds the cheapest
route and returns its movement cost.

For example, to add a route cost to each enemy's token, import route_cost and NO_ROUTE in
encoder.py and add "route_cost" to ENTITY_FEATURES. Then add this line to the enemy branch of
encode_entities, change VERSION, and recollect and retrain. We divide by NO_ROUTE to keep the
number small, like the token's other entries:

    values["route_cost"] = route_cost(observation, own["position"], unit["position"]) / NO_ROUTE
