"""The Season 4 starter tactical blocks: a working action space for a strategic layer.

A block is one job a unit can be given, written as a plain function::

    decide(observation, memory, goal) -> order or None

``goal`` is the position the job is about, or None. ``memory`` is this unit's own dictionary,
private to it, where a block keeps anything it needs to remember under a key of its own name.
Returning None means the situation is not this block's: the unit is holding a job that has
nothing to say right now, and whoever called it should fall back to something else. A block
that needs a destination and is handed None uses the middle of the field.

Blocks read the action mask and never plan a route. Each one asks ``action.legal_paths`` for the
paths that are legal this activation, looks at the tile each one lands on, and picks the landing
it likes best, so every order is legal by construction. Only the landing tile is scored, because
a path's middle tiles change nothing about what happens when the walking stops. The exception is
Season 6's wasteland, where entering a wasted tile costs hit points and two routes onto the same
tile can charge very different prices, so scoring routes rather than destinations becomes work
worth doing. There is no pathfinder here either: getting a unit across the field to somewhere it
cannot reach this activation is still your own.

Every score in this file is a tuple that is minimized, so lower is better throughout, and a
condition worth preferring is written as ``0 if wanted else 1``.

:func:`assign` is the placeholder. It hands each unit one block and one goal at the start of the
match and never revisits the choice, which is exactly the piece Season 4 asks you to replace:
deciding which units should do what and where, and when those assignments should change as the
battle turns.
