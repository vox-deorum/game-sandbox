"""Capture zones: the ground worth holding, fixed for the whole match.

Zones are set once when the battlefield is generated and never move, resize, or appear
mid-match; a match not playing capture simply has none. These helpers describe geometry and who
is standing where. What that presence is worth, the running score and target, lives at
``observation["observation"]["capture"]``, and these helpers never touch it.
