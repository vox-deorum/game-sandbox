"""The shared, dependency-free playing-card codec for the trick-taking games.

Single source of truth for how a 52-card deck is numbered and how a card crosses between the integer
rules engines and the semantic object an agent, overlay, or renderer reads. It imports only the
standard library, so the Hearts and Spades engines share one encoding without a third-party
dependency, and it syncs verbatim into the student template as ``sandbox.card_utils``.

Two rank conventions live side by side and must never be interchanged:

* **Engine index** (``0..12``). A card is an int ``0..51`` with ``card = suit * 13 + rank_index``,
  suits ``0=clubs, 1=diamonds, 2=spades, 3=hearts``, ranks ``0=2 .. 9=J, 10=Q, 11=K, 12=A``.
  :func:`suit_of` / :func:`rank_of` decode it; the engines compare on this index (the queen is ``10``).
* **Face value** (``2..14``). The agent's object ``{"suit": <0..3>, "rank": <2..14>}`` uses familiar
  values (jack ``11``, queen ``12``, ace ``14``). :func:`card_to_obj` / :func:`card_from_obj` are the
  only place the offset is applied, and only at the ``env.py`` / ``overlay.py`` boundary.

The queen of spades pins both at once: card id ``36``, :func:`rank_of` ``10`` (engine index),
semantic ``{"suit": 2, "rank": 12}`` (face value). Using ``card_to_obj(c)["rank"]`` where the engine
expects ``rank_of(c)`` shifts every rank by two and silently corrupts the engine.
