"""Everything placed once the ground, the buildings, and the routes are committed.

Dressing changes no ground. A prop reserves its catalog rectangle turned to its facing, stands on
the class already painted under it, and banks one standing cell it can be used from. That witness is
found when the prop is placed and protected from everything placed after it, which is what makes the
guarantee hold without any stage having to look back.

Most spots come off the road. A station is a point along the road's centreline with the direction of
travel there, so a stall, a lantern, a shrine, or a pine can be set a fixed distance to one side of
it and turned to face the road. The market is the stretch of that centreline nearest the anchor.

Stalls, the board, benches, shrines, gardens, the interior props, the pump, and the bell are
mandatory: running out of candidates discards the layout. Lanterns and pines are not. They skip a
blocked spot and carry on, and what fits is kept in the shipped village.
