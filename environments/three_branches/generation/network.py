"""The road, its bridges, and the spawn.

The road is carved the way a water course is: a brush on a heading that blends momentum, a pull
toward wherever it is going next, a climb toward drier ground, repulsion from water, a push off the
band edges, a meander, and a little wobble. What makes it a road rather than a river is what it is
not allowed to do. It never paints water except inside a bridge it already proved, and it never runs
back over its own trail. One deck per channel and one connected road follow from the walk itself
rather than from a check afterwards.

Bridges are chosen before the walk. A crossing is the shortest straight cut across a channel inside
the band that lands on dry bank at both ends, preferring the row nearest the crossing before it so
the road does not zigzag between channels. The walker then runs straight through each one, which is
what makes a deck come out square at the width the road was carved with.

The road reads moisture and not elevation for its dry ground. The elevation field carries a
southward bias that runs one way across the band, so climbing it would only pin the road to an edge.
