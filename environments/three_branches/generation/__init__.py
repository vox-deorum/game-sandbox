"""Seeded village generation for Days at Three Branches.

``build_village`` is the seam the environment resets through. ``generate`` is the same work plus an
internal report that only the guarantee suite and the batch summary read. Both run one labelled
stream, ``random.Random(f"{seed}:village")``, which is separate from anything a match plays with, so
the same build and the same seed always produce the same village.

Construction runs terrain fields, water, ground classes, the district anchors and their building
sites, the road with its bridges and the spawn, the footpaths, and then the dressing. Each stage
reads what the ones before it committed, and checks its own work as it goes. A mandatory stage that
runs out of candidates raises ``Retry``, which discards the partial village and draws the whole
layout again on the same stream.

Assembly is the last word. Lanterns and pines are optional, so a village that will not connect is
first tried without its pines and then without its lanterns before the layout is drawn again. That
ladder re-runs no stage, so the land, the road, and the buildings under review never move.
