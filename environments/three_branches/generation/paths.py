"""Footpaths. Where one goes is searched; how it gets there is walked.

A footpath is somebody's way to a door, so the search is asked one question only: what this route
has to join, and where it may cross water to get there. It prices a cell by how fast a body moves
over it and discounts a path already worn, which is what makes a new route meet an old one rather
than run beside it. Every road and bridge cell is a source at no cost, so a route is a spur off the
nearest way that already carries people rather than a line from one chosen point.

What comes back is a plan and not a shape. An ant walks it from the doorstep, pulled toward where it
is going, swinging across that line on a meander of its own, and nudged by a wobble every step. It
stops the moment it meets a way that already carries people, whatever the plan still had in mind,
which is what makes paths run together instead of side by side. Water it crosses only on the
straight run the search proved. When it runs out of room to turn, or out of steps, the rest of its
leg is painted along the plan, so a doorway the search could reach is always joined.

``joinable`` answers the other question this module is asked: whether somewhere could ever be joined
to the road at all, which is what lets a building site reject a doorway before it is painted.

One walk draws its gait per route and its wobble per step. Everything else here is deterministic,
and ties break on the cell.
