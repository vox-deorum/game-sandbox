"""Validated generation tuning for the seeded village.

Every number the generator draws with lives in ``generation.json``. Code and tests read values from
here instead of restating them, so a tuning pass is a data edit. The document is validated when the
generation package imports, and the cross-group checks at the end of ``load`` are the arithmetic that
keeps the guarantees reachable: three mouths fit the south edge, and the widest trunk enters inside
its band. They bound what tuning allows, and each stage still checks the village it actually drew.

A group lands when its stage lands, so every number shipped here has a consumer.

A ``budget`` is a candidate budget: how many placements a mandatory stage may draw and test before
it gives up, discards the layout, and draws again. ``step_budget`` is not one of those; it counts a
walker's steps. Lantern and pine placement carries no budget at all, because an invalid spot there
is skipped rather than redrawn.
