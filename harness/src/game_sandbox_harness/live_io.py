"""Transport primitives for the live session runner.

These are the container-side halves of the Stage 3 transport: the inbound command pump and
its shared control state, the :class:`PausableClock` that freezes time on pause, the
:class:`TransportSource` that feeds an external player from latched inputs, the protocol output
stream, and the tee that mirrors recording bytes onto that stream. The runner that wires them
together lives in :mod:`game_sandbox_harness.live`; everything here is independently testable
on a :class:`~game_sandbox_harness.clock.ManualClock`.

The line shapes are defined in the Stage 3 transport plan. Outbound: recording lines
(header + per-step states, never carrying a top-level ``kind``) and event envelopes (a
top-level ``kind``; this stage emits one, ``result``). Inbound command envelopes carry a
``kind`` and, where applicable, a ``player`` and ``action`` or ``text``: ``input``, ``pause``,
``resume``, ``stop``, and ``chat`` (a human message, ``player`` + ``to`` + ``text``). Unknown
kinds and malformed lines are logged and ignored, so the container never dies because a
client sent garbage. Human ``chat`` frames enter one bounded designated-sender FIFO, not the input
latch: inputs coalesce to the latest value, but messages must not swallow each other.
