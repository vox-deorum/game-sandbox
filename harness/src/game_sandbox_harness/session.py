"""The single session loop and the step machinery beneath it.

One loop serves sequential and simultaneous environments alike. A sequential step asks its
acting player for an action, while a parallel tick snapshots every active player before it
collects their actions. Live pacing remains outside this module, and headless callers advance
without a wall-clock cadence.

The machinery is exposed as an :class:`Episode`: it owns the reset env and recording writer,
delegates participant accounting to a private runner, and advances one declared unit through
:meth:`Episode.advance`. :func:`run_episode` and the live runner share that dispatch point.
The Stage 2 sequential determinism fixtures remain the regression gate for the AEC path.

A player is bound either to a loaded agent (:class:`AgentPlayer`, governed by the cooperative
agent-timeout machinery) or to an external action source (:class:`ExternalPlayer`, which is
what "human" means to the harness). The two paths are deliberately separate: external players
never consult the per-step agent limit and their ``None`` fallback involves no measurement
or overage accounting.
