"""The submission load check: ``python -m game_sandbox_harness.validate``.

The dynamic half of submission validation (Stage 5.4). It runs the very same
:func:`~game_sandbox_harness.manifest.load_agent` a live session uses — put the repo root on
``sys.path``, import the entry-point module, instantiate the named class, and confirm the instance
exposes callable ``reset``/``act`` — **exactly once**, and it never constructs or steps the
environment. That is the whole command: import-and-construct, classify, report.

It emits one structured result envelope on stdout (the protocol stream, classified the same way the
session runner's output is — stdout is protocol, stderr is diagnostics) and exits ``0`` on success
or ``1`` on a load failure, so the backend turns the typed ``code`` into the owner-visible message.
The closed failure set is ``import_error`` (the module failed to import, or resolved outside the
repo root), ``class_not_found`` (the manifest names a class the module does not define),
``constructor_error`` (instantiation raised), and ``missing_hook`` (no callable ``reset``/``act``),
each carrying the underlying Python error as ``detail`` for the owner's debug view.

The static manifest checks (present, valid JSON, required fields, known/ matching template version)
are **not** the gate here: that is the backend's step-3 mirror, which already ran before the build.
``load_agent`` does re-parse the manifest, so a manifest problem would still surface, but in the
pipeline it never reaches this command.
