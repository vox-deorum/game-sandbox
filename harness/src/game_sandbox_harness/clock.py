"""The injectable clock.

Every duration in the harness is a difference of two clock readings, so swapping the
clock swaps the entire timing basis. :class:`SystemClock` reads the wall clock for real
sessions; :class:`ManualClock` advances only when told to, which makes a recording a pure
function of seed plus agent behaviour and lets the determinism tests compare two recordings
byte-for-byte with no tolerance window.
