"""Game Sandbox session harness.

Stage 1 shipped the cross-boundary contract pieces: schema validation, typed state builders,
and the recording store. Stage 2 adds the session loop and its surrounding machinery — the
agent interface, the manifest loader, the environment metadata and registry, the injectable
clock, and ``run_episode`` with its player bindings and action sources. Stage 3 factors the loop
into an ``Episode`` whose ``step_once`` both ``run_episode`` and the live container runner drive.
Environments live in a separate package discovered through entry points; the harness never
imports them.
