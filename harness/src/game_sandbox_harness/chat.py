"""Message routing and validation for the optional ``chat`` hook.

This is the correctness core of agent communication, deliberately separate from the session
loop: every outbound rule in the communication spec is enforced here at one point, so the
session loop only ever hands a validated batch to the recording and the router only ever
decides delivery. The module imports nothing from :mod:`session` or :mod:`live_io` so it stays
cycle-free; it needs only the :class:`~game_sandbox_harness.state.Message` shape.

A :class:`ChatRouter` exists only when messaging is effectively enabled for the episode (the
environment metadata and the session config agree). With messaging off, no router is created and
the loop is byte-identical to a pre-chat run.

Validation is a drop-with-diagnostic discipline, never a raise: a chatty agent's malformed
message must not take down the session, exactly as an illegal *action* is charged and refused
without smearing the fault across every seat. Rejections print one stderr diagnostic (the
harness never configures logging, so an INFO record would be silently dropped) and continue.
